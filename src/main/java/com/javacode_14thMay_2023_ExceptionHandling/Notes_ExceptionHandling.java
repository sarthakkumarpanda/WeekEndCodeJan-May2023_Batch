	//Difference between Exception and Error
	/*
	 * //Exception occurs because of our programs but Error occurs because of lack
	 * of System resources //Exceptions are recoverable. i.e., programmer can handle
	 * them using try-catch block but //Errors are not recoverable. //Exceptions are
	 * of two types: - //i. Compile Time or Checked Exceptions //ii. RunTime or
	 * Unchecked Exceptions //but Errors are only of one type - Runtime or Unchecked
	 * Exceptions
