	//final concept of String is related to the Class String
	
	//final is a keyword in java which is used with Classes, Methods and Variables
	//Anything which is termed final cannot be changed.

	//String Class is final because String class has features which is not available
	//to other java classes. This prevents sub-classes to try implementing changes to the 
	//String class.
	
	//Hence anything within the String Class cannot be modified. 
	
	//immutability concept is different from final concept
	//String immutability is related to String Objects
	//String final concept is related to String Classes
