	//Methods vs Constructors
	//1. Constructors do not have a return type but methods have a return type
	//2. The name of the constructor always is the class name but methods can have any name
	//3. Constructors get invoked the moment an Object is created. That is not the case with methods
	//4. Methods can be inherited but constructors cannot be inherited
	//5. Constructors cannot be made static but methods can be made static
	
	//private, public, default, protected - can be used with Constructors
	
	//uses of constructor
	//1. Constructors are used to initialize an object
	//2. They are used to optimize code
	
	//Types of constructors
	//1. Default constructor (this gets invoked the moment an object is created)
	//2. No argument constructor (This is user defined)
	//3. Parameterized constructor (This is also user defined)
	
	//Misconception
	//Constructors are used to create Objects [Please do not answer this in interview]
