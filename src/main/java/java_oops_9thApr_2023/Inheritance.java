public class Inheritance {
	
	//Classes - Parent, Child/Sub Class
	//These concepts will work only if you design a Parent and respective Children Classes
	
	//Child class inherits some of the properties of the parent Class
	//Parent class does not inherit from the Child Class
	
	//Object acquires properties/behavior of its parent Object
	
	//Advantages:-
	//Code - Reusability
	//We can use Polymorphism
	
	//Disadvantage - 2 Classes are tightly coupled with each other
	
	//What you cannot inherit ?
	//Private method
	//Constructor
	
	//Single Level, Multi-Level, Hierarchical
